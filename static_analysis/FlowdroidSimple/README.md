This repo is here to store some code for simple flowdroid boilerplate to analyse apks. The goal is to have some tools that work and farm some low hanging insights :)

This is an Eclipse project, add libs to the classpath and build/run that way.

Has a number of simple analysis passes via flowdroid that extract some information

## Problems

CFG is not very accurate but running with callbacks enabled has not yet terminated...
